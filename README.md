## Products list with react-redux

This is an exercise, using react-redux and reduxjs/toolkit.

It is a re-factored case, from an Udemy exercise using react-redux in the old-fashioned way, without the toolkit.

In using reduxjs/toolkit, the resulting code is far more simplified, versus the Udemy exercise from year 2018.

## To run this case

- Install the json server: npm install -g json-server
- Create "db.json" file in the root directory Populate with any data, just following the same schema, as in this example
- Run the server: json-server db.json --port 4000
- All above actions are made easy from Visual Studio Code, where you can open two terminals, one for the front-end and the other for the back-end
